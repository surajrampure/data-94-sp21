    "Unlike in the homework assignments, the test cases that you see in this notebook **are not** the final test cases that your quiz will be graded on. The test cases that you see in this notebook only test your code on one example (typically one that is given in the question), but your final grade on each question will be determined using a series of \"hidden tests\" which you will only see once we release grades. **In other words, just because you see `q3 passed!` does not necessarily mean you answered Question 3 correctly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "That means, after you complete a question, you should try out a few examples on your own to make sure your code is doing what it is supposed to. We will also be manually grading your code to make sure it truly does what it is supposed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 questions in this quiz, each worth 3 points (not including Question 0, which is required but worth 0 points). **However, the maximum possible score on this quiz is 12.** This means that of the 5 questions on the quiz, you only need to complete 4 for full credit. If you complete all 5, you will not receive any extra credit (i.e. the max score is still 12/12), but it may help you in the event that you don't receive full credit on one of your other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question has 6 test cases, but you only get to see 1 of them in this notebook. Each test case is worth an equal number of points. You will see your full score on the quiz within a few days of submitting.\n",
