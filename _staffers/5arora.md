Hi! My name is Sukrit and I am a 5th Year MS student in EECS. As an undergraduate, I was a GSI for 5 semesters for a variety of courses (EE16B, CS61C, EE120, EECS127). My academic interests are primarily in computational imaging and signal processing, both of which involve statistical analysis (and other concepts found in data science). When Iâ€™m not busy with work, I enjoy binge watching TV shows, eating new foods, and traveling (not so much anymore, thanks covid). Looking forward to meeting you all (virtually) this semester!
