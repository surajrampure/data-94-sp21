My name is Angela Guan, and I am from San Jose, CA. I am a 4th year studying Data Science, and I love data science! I took Data 8 in my 1st semester at Cal and have been on course staff for 7 semesters. I am on the Cal Table Tennis team, and I enjoy going to beaches, hiking, baking, traveling, and trying out new things to eat. Looking forward to meeting you!
