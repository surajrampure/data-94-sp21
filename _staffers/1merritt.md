I have been a part of the CS10 staff for 7 semesters (1 as a student, 1 as an AI, 2 as a Reader, and 3 as a GSI), and I am super excited to be here teaching Data 94! I have taken Data 8 and Data 100 on my way to becoming a Data Science Minor, so I am delighted to be teaching data science to all of you this semester!
