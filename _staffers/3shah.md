Hey! I am a 3rd year EECS major from India. Like a majority of you, I came to Cal knowing next to nothing about data science and programming and yet here I am! It was an introductory class, very much like this class, that made me fall in love with computational thinking and I wish to play my part in introducing to you the world of Data Science and Computational Thinking! Looking forward to a great semester!
