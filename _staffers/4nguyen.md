Hi! My name is Anna, and I’m an MPH student in Epidemiology and Biostatistics. During my time at Cal, I’ve spent 7 semesters on Data 8 course staff and 3 semesters on Data 140 staff. Outside of Data Science, I enjoy watching dogs on the Glade, drinking copious amounts of coffee, and binging trashy reality TV.
