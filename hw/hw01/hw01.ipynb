    "- Underscores (`_`) are how we make words italicized. `How are _you_?` renders to How are _you_?, and `what is **_up_**` renders to what is **_up_**.\n",
    "- Hashtags (`#`, `##`, `###`) are how we create titles/headings. The more hashtags you include, the smaller the title is. The title for this question was generated using `## Question 5 – Markdown`.\n",
    "- Unbulleted and bulleted lists are created the same way they're created in a standard word processor, like Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is important to learn because Jupyter Notebooks are often full of Markdown cells (just like this assignment). In future assignments, we will ask you to write answers to written questions using Markdown, and while the majority of your answers will be in plaintext (i.e. with none of the special characters above), learning Markdown is valuable nonetheless.\n",
