# Homework 9 â€“ Create a Website

### Data 94, Spring 2021

This homework is due on **Thursday, April 29th, 2021.** Submission instructions for this assignment are a little different (nothing is uploaded to Gradescope); read the instructions carefully.

## Overview

In this final homework of the semester, you will create a public-facing website with text, tables, and visualizations that you will create on your own, using a dataset that you chose on your own. You'll be able to share this website link with anyone you want.

As you can see, we aren't distributing this assignment to you in the form of a Jupyter notebook. Instead, we're providing you with all of the instructions here.

Don't worry â€“ even though this assignment looks quite different than those prior, we've designed it to be relatively straightforward and not that time-consuming. We promise you'll enjoy it!

Here's a brief summary of each part of the assignment, along with a time estimate.

1. Finding a dataset and creating a visualization of interest (1-2 hours).
2. Creating a GitHub account and publishing a blank website (~30 minutes).
3. Copying your content to your website (~30 minutes).
4. Submission (~15 minutes).

## Part 1 â€“ Finding a Dataset and Creating a Visualization ðŸŽ¨

1. Find a dataset you want to work with in the CSV format and download it to your computer. Slides 13 and 14 of [Lecture 33](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wA1taEpdonSa-WTuDriNwK6vWOMHewj14nejHZBlFHc/edit#slide=id.gd34f647e78_0_0) list several potential sources.
  - Try your best not to overlap datasets with others in the class, though if this happens by coincidence that's fine.
  - You may want to find more than one dataset in the event you aren't able to make any interesting visualizations using your first choice.
  - TODO: don't look for datasets with maps.

2. Follow the steps in Slides 16-18 of [Lecture 33](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wA1taEpdonSa-WTuDriNwK6vWOMHewj14nejHZBlFHc/edit#slide=id.gd34f64800a_2_13) to create a new notebook with the necessary import statements and upload your dataset to your DataHub.
- Using `Table.read_table`, load in your dataset and save it to a variable. You should now be good to go to perform any analysis you want.

3. Get familiarized with the data.
- There are no concrete steps we have for you here, since it depends on your data. For example, you may want to `group` to see the distribution of a particular column, or draw a `scatter` plot to understand the relationship between two numerical columns. **We're not grading you on this step, it's more just for you to understand the data you've chosen.**

4. Create a visualization.
- TODO: no maps.

5. Write two paragraphs.

TODO: make example notebook and put link

## Part 2 â€“ Creating a GitHub Account and a Blank Website ðŸ’»

1. Create a [GitHub](http://github.com) account (go to the site and click "Sign Up" in the top right).
- Your username is up to you, but it may be a good idea to choose something professional since you might use this account in the future for something else. Your website URL will contain your username.
- After entering your credentials, it may ask you questions like "What kind of work do you do, mainly?". You can skip these; scroll all the way to the bottom and continue.
- You'll then need to verify your email address.

2. Create a new **repository**. It may prompt you to do this after verifying your email; if it doesn't, you can click the circular cat logo in the top left of your screen and then click the green button in the left pane.
- A repository, or repo for short, is like a folder for a project.
- You will need to select a name for the repository. Name it something related to the dataset that you visualized in the previous part, since your repo name will end up in the URL of your website. **Don't** name it "94-homework" or something like that.
- Make sure to select **Public** and **Add a README file.** Overall, your settings should look like this (but with a different repo name):
    <div align="center">
    <img src="../images/repo.png" width="500">
    </div>

3. Enable **GitHub Pages** for your repo. GitHub Pages is the feature we will use to create our website. Follow these steps:
    1. From this page, click "Settings".
        <div align="center">
        <img src="../images/mainpage.png" width="500">
        </div>
    2. Click "Pages" in the menu on the left (it should be towards the bottom).
    3. Under "Source", change "None" to "main". Click "Save".
    4. Under "Theme Chooser", click "Choose a theme". It will allow you to choose one of several themes; pick the one you like the most and click "Select theme". If you end up not liking your choice, you can always come back to this menu and change the theme, so don't worry. **Note:** If you are brought to a page that has you try and edit your file (it may say something like "Edit new file"), just click "Cancel".
    5. After you follow these steps, your site will be public. You will be shown its URL, but it will be in the form `<your github username>.github.io/<your repo name>`. Keep a tab open with your website while working on the rest of the assignment.
        <div align="center">
        <img src="../images/showurl.png" width="500">
        </div>

## Part 3 â€“ Building Your Website ðŸ”¨

1. Navigate back to the main page for your repo by clicking its name in the top-left of your screen. It should now look something like this, though the file `README.md` might not have very much in it.
    <div align="center">
    <img src="../images/afterpages.png" width="500">
    </div>

2. The `README.md` file is where you'll put all of your content for your website (`.md` denotes Markdown, the format we discussed at the start of the semester). To edit `README.md` (both now and moving forward), you'll need to click the pencil icon. (In the screenshot above, it's right under the "4 minutes ago" text.)
- You should be brought to an interface that allows you to edit `README.md`.

3. Delete everything currently in `README.md`. TODO: talk about what to put here â€“ give the page a title, put a paragraph about where you got the code, put TODOs for where your visualization and table will go, etc. Put screenshot of what that looks like. Remember that everything we're writing here is in Markdown.

4. TODO talk about committing, give some analogy. After committing, go back to your website, and refresh. Eventually you should see a nicely formatted version of everything you just wrote. It may take a few minutes. TODO put screenshot of our example.

5. Now we'll want to show the first few rows of our table on our website. Use this function to do that. TODO put that function here and put screenshots of how it's used.

6. Now your website is close, but it's missing the pizzazz â€“ your visualization! Here's how you'll get your visualization from your notebook to your website. Go back to your notebook that you created in Part 1.
    1. Like in the homeworks, make sure you've assigned your visualization to a variable name and used `show = False`. Remember, no maps allowed. TODO put screenshot of my visualization code.
    2. Run this code.
    3. Copy the output of that code.
    4. Edit `README.md` again, and now replace the TODO: VISUALIZATION with the nasty looking code you just copied. TODO show screenshot here. Make sure to commit after.

7. After committing in the previous stage, refresh your website until it loads. If you're happy with the result, congrats! If not, feel free to tweak things. One suggestion is to change the `width` and `height` of your image in your notebook before exporting. (You can repeat the previous step as many times as you want.)

## Part 4 â€“ Submission âœ…

1. Make sure your website is finalized before moving on.
2. Instead of submitting anything to Gradescope, you're going to upload the notebook you created in Part 1 to GitHub too! Here's how:
    1. Navigate back to your notebook, save, restart, run all cells, and save again.
    2. Go to "File > Download as > .ipynb".
    3. Navigate to the main page of your repo, and click "Add file" then "Upload files". Then click "Choose your files" and select the notebook you just downloaded.
    4. Click "Commit changes".
3. Post two links on Ed: TODO
