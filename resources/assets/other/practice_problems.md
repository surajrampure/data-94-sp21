# Practice Problems by Topic

This page lists old homework and quiz problems, organized by topic in the course. This list is not necessarily comprehensive, but nevertheless we hope you find it useful. Furthermore, this page **does not** enumerate examples in lecture or Quick Checks; you should definitely refer to these in your studying as well.

### Homeworks

To access blank copies of old homeworks, follow these instructions. (Repeat these instructions for each homework, we will use Homework 4 as an example.).
1. Go to your DataHub and rename the `hw04` folder to something else (say, `hw04-old`).
2. Click the Homework 4 link on the course website. This will bring you to a fresh copy of Homework 4.

**Remember that homework solutions are all posted on Ed.** The solutions for Homework X are posted in the "Homework X grades are relased!" post.
